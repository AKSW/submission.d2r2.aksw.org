The frequency of wildfires increases yearly and poses a constant threat to the environment and human beings. Different factors, for example surrounding infrastructure to an area (e.g., campfire sites or power lines) contribute to the occurrence of wildfires. In this paper, we propose using a \gls*{stkg} based on \gls*{osm} data for modeling such infrastructure. Based on that knowledge graph, we use the RDF2vec approach to create embeddings for predicting wildfires, and we align different vector spaces generated at each temporal step by partial rotation. In an experimental study, we determine the effect of the surrounding infrastructure by comparing different data composition strategies, which involve a prediction based on tabular data, a combination of tabular data and embeddings, and solely embeddings. We show that the incorporation of the \gls*{stkg} increases the prediction quality of wildfires.
