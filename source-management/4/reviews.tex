1  &  3    &  1) It seems that the approach can be implemented without tKG, by simply adding the timestamp of the event as a property.
Further, to the best of my knowledge, no triplestores support such a triple format.
My question is, why not use a simple model?
What are the advantages of registering the timestamp in each event triple?
I haven't seen any.      &  "We have opted to utilize quadruples as our chosen representation, as they are widely employed in the field of tKG forecasting research, see e.g. TODO."

pweh. this needs some thoughts. we are doing this to use it for downstream analysis tasks, where triplestores are not used.
\newline Lorenz: From a KG perspective, this might be correct, but the tKG domain does always refer to quads where a triple + a timestamp is used. Moreover, the tKG data isn't loaded into a triple store for the ML tasks anymore. Minor comment: there is at least one triple store that would allow for temporal data, AllegroGraph tough not relevant for us

2  &  2    &    2) what is the number of entities per class?    &   ? not sure which classes? we do not classify yet?       vllt bestimmte deduktionen ueber die einzelnen gta/acled: was ist anteil and gta/acled? datenset gross genug um klassifiezuerungsaufgabe zu beantworten, nicht nur 10 events von einem/anderen TODO: wie viele gehoeren zu acled und wie viele zu GTA?
\newline Lorenz: The question is just about the number of instances per class, isn't it?

3  &  ?4?    &     3) I suggest adding a SPARQL query to show how to query and acquire discussed insights.   &          ? not sure what reviewer wants here? we added the sparql queries for the dataset creation, and we will not use sparql queries later in process  
\newline Lorenz: I guess it's about your data analysis which you did via Python code? E.g. counting and the like? But I'm not sure either.
&   ?   &    ?                                   &  not doing. we had  sparql queries for everything we did with sparql, and for the rest I used python, ende aus.\\

8  &  ?    &   Although the method of KG creation is clearly described, its traceability could have been enhanced if declarative mapping languages had been used to specify this process.  
  &   not sure what they want here? I think this is nothing that we can fix given the short time   
  \newline Lorenz: I'm sure they would expect some RML or R2RML mapping files here instead of TARQL + pre/post-processing 
  Julia: not doing. too late to change our way of working, maybe next time.
