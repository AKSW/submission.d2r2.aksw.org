We have presented a novel approach to understanding global crises and trade patterns. For this, our paper outlines the curation process of a tKG from publicly available dynamic data and includes a comprehensive analysis of this tKG. 
Additionally, we have defined requirements for tKG forecasting models to be used with this dataset.

Leveraging tKG is a promising way to understand the intersection between global crises and trade data over time. 
In the future, we plan to apply tKG forecasting models within the CoyPu project to predict future trade alert events based on the historical global trade and crisis data, taking into account the key takeaways highlighted in Section~\ref{sec:takeaway}. 
Our ultimate goal is to enhance our understanding of crises and trade patterns and to contribute to a more effective decision-making process in response to emerging crises.
