\begin{abstract}
In the face of continuously changing contextual conditions and ubiquitous disruptive crisis events, the concept of resilience refers to some of the most urgent, challenging, and interesting issues of nowadays society. Economic value networks, technical infrastructures, health systems, and social textures alike need to unfold capacities to withstand, adapt, recover, or even refine and transform themselves to stay ahead of changes.

%\section{Introduction}

The D2R2’23 workshop (\url{https://d2r2.aksw.org/}), which is organized by the CoyPu project (\url{https://coypu.org/}), provides an open forum to exchange current issues, ideas, and trends in the area of Data-driven Resilience Research among scientists, software engineers, resilience practitioners, and domain experts. Ongoing technological developments, current research approaches as well as use case scenarios, and field reports are presented and discussed with a broad and multi-disciplinary specialist audience. We have received contributions of novel results, ongoing work, and position papers focusing on various aspects of Data-driven Resilience Research from a scientific or practical perspective.

The workshop is held during the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) in Crete, Greece.
The co-location of the workshop with ESWC allows a wide exchange among the community of Semantic Web experts, data scientists, knowledge engineers, and further interested parties.

For the workshop, we received a total of 11 contributions, out of which 7 were selected to be included in the proceedings. These are 6 full papers and 1 short paper.

The D2R2 workshop's first issue~\cite{D2R2-22} was held at the Data Week Leipzig 2022.
