abstract = {Detection of fake news has spurred widespread interests in areas such as healthcare and Internet societies, in order to prevent propagating misleading information for commercial and political purposes. However, efforts to study a general framework for exploiting knowledge, for judging the trustworthiness of given news based on their content, have been limited. Indeed, the existing works rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which could provide rich structured knowledge for better language understanding. In this work, we propose a deep triple network (DTN) that leverages knowledge graphs to facilitate fake news detection with triple-enhanced explanations. In the DTN, background knowledge graphs, such as open knowledge graphs and extracted graphs from news bases, are applied for both low-level and high-level feature extraction to classify the input news article and provide explanations for the classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by demonstrating abundant convincing comparative experiments. Obtained results show that DTN outperforms conventional fake news detection methods from different aspects, including the provision of factual evidence supporting the decision of fake news detection.}

abstract="With the proliferation of fake news in the last few years, especially during the COVID-19 period, combating the spread of misinformation has become an urgent need. Although automated fact-checking systems were proposed recently, they leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy and explainability. Therefore, involving humans during verification could make the process much easier and more reliable. In this work, we propose an automated approach to detect claims that have been already manually-verified by professional fact-checkers. Our proposed approach uses recent powerful BERT variants as point-wise rerankers. Additionally, we study the impact of using different fields of the verified claim during training and inference phases. Experimental results show that our proposed pipeline outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on two English and one Arabic datasets.",

    abstract = "The recent proliferation of {''}fake news{''} has triggered a number of responses, most notably the emergence of several manual fact-checking initiatives. As a result and over time, a large number of fact-checked claims have been accumulated, which increases the likelihood that a new claim in social media or a new statement by a politician might have already been fact-checked by some trusted fact-checking organization, as viral claims often come back after a while in social media, and politicians like to repeat their favorite statements, true or false, over and over again. As manual fact-checking is very time-consuming (and fully automatic fact-checking has credibility issues), it is important to try to save this effort and to avoid wasting time on claims that have already been fact-checked. Interestingly, despite the importance of the task, it has been largely ignored by the research community so far. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we formulate the task and we discuss how it relates to, but also differs from, previous work. We further create a specialized dataset, which we release to the research community. Finally, we present learning-to-rank experiments that demonstrate sizable improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval and textual similarity approaches.",
