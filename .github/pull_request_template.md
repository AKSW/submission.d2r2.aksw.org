## Agreement Form

### First Run
- [ ] Created directory `agreement-form/SUB_NUMBER`
- [ ] Updated `agreement-form/SUB_NUMBER/metadata.yml`

⏳ Hang on, now the workflow action will run 🎡 to compile all artifacts 📦 and the agreement form 📝 to by signed by you.
(If you are new to github the workflow requires our manual approval.)

When the workflow has finished successfully our robot 🤖 should comment on your pull-request with the links to the artifacts, including the form to be signed.

### Second Run
- [ ] Hand-signed the completely filled agreement form ✍️
- [ ] Uploaded a scan of the agreement form to `agreement-form/SUB_NUMBER/agreement.pdf`

> **Mistakes in the editor/author agreements.**<br/>
> Some editors/authors still copy/paste bitmaps of their signatures into the copyright agreements or sign on a touchscreen, instead of signing physically with a pen on paper. Further some authors forget to completely fill out the form.<br/>
> (https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#TOPERRORS)

- [ ] The agreement form is HAND SIGNED with a PEN ON PAPER
